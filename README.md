 ##BCA Internship - 6th Semester##

Skills4Future Internship on Green Skills & AI

🌱 AI & ML Learning Journey

This repository is a comprehensive record of my hands-on learning experience in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) during the Green Skills & AI internship.

Throughout this journey, I explored supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, applied AI concepts to real-world problem-solving, and gained insights into sustainable technology practices.

📌 Key Topics Covered

🔹 Supervised Learning – Making Predictions & Classifications

Regression Techniques for predictive modeling:

✅ Linear Regression – Understanding relationships between variables

Classification Models for decision-making:

✅ Decision Trees – Interpretable & rule-based learning

✅ Random Forest – Ensemble learning for accuracy

🔹 Unsupervised Learning – Finding Hidden Patterns in Data

Clustering Algorithms to group similar data points

Dimensionality Reduction for visualization & feature extraction:

✅ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – Reducing high-dimensional data

✅ t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) – Visualizing complex datasets

🔹 Green Skills & AI for Sustainability 🌍
